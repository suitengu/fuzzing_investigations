# Fuzzing assimp with afl++ writeup
A harness and notes for fuzzing the assimp asset importer library.

*Currently only FBX format is targeted.*

*As of Oct 21, 2026 Investigation is ongoing.*

## Notes
This build was made for a WSL2 environment, so some package versions may be unusual and some build issues may be unnecessary when compared to a more current Linux environment.

## Checking out the assimp source to ./assimp that will be instrumented by afl++
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:assimp/assimp.git
```

## (Optional) Checking out the assimp source to ./assimp-uninstrumented that is currently used for running the `test` binary to verify and debug findings in a build of assimp without AFL instrumentation.
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:assimp/assimp.git assimp-uninstrumented
```

## Setup the seeds/inputs dir
This is likely overkill and could be refined, but I just used all the test .fbx models that ship with assimp. Some of these may be highly nonstandard or sub-optimal for fuzzing, but using larger, real scenes (ie. Sponza) would be much worse.

``` bash
mkdir inputs
cp /test/models/FBX/*.fbx inputs/
cp /test/models-nonbsd/FBX/2013_ASCII/*.fbx inputs:
cp /test/models-nonbsd/FBX/2013_BINARY/*.fbx inputs/
```

## Configuring and building assimp with AFL instrumentation
I first had to edit out all occurrences of `-Wno-deprecated-non-prototype` in the CMakeLists.txt files, because the versions of clang++ and afl-clang++ available on WSL2 do not support this option and the build fails.
``` bash
cd assimp
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=afl-clang-fast -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=afl-clang-fast++ -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DASSIMP_BUILD_ZLIB=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build .
```
Release build is required (or to retain Debug build functionality, code that defines the `ai_assert` macro could be modified, but I found this gets too messy). The `ai_assert` macro in Debug builds causes the program to exit on the invalid inputs that afl++ generates, but the macro does nothing in release builds, which is where any interesting findings would likely apply, anyway.

## Running with the fuzzer

``` bash
make clean
make all
afl-fuzz -i inputs/ -o findings/ -- ./harness
```

To work around WSL2 issue with `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`
``` bash
sudo su
echo core > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
exit
```

On first run, I was getting crash findings within a few seconds. This seems too "good" to be true -- too easy, right? Using the test program so I can trace through execution with `gdb`:
``` bash
gdb test
run ./findings/default/crashes/id:000000,sig:11,src:001838,time:435378,execs:4388236,op:havoc,rep:2
```

Output:
```
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0000555555c54c28 in std::__shared_ptr_access<Assimp::FBX::PropertyTable const, (__gnu_cxx::_Lock_policy)2, false, false>::_M_get() const ()
```

Investigating the backtrace, I see this:

```

```

(an enormous, multi-page output of lines that are all like the bottom line follows)

The segmentation fault is due to a stack overflow. 

Increasing the stack size via:
``` bash
ulimit -s unlimited
```
results in these cases being reported instead as "hangs" where the program receives SIGKILL instead.

Investigating the cause of this, there is a recursive call to ConvertNodes within FBXCovnerter.cpp (as of this writing, line 348):

```c++
            // recursion call - child nodes
            ConvertNodes(model->ID(), last_parent, root_node, new_abs_transform);
```

I tried to investigate further, but stepping through the stack and running `print` on these variables only gave the `<value optimized out>` For further exploration, "test" / debugging build of the assimp library may be attempted with compiler optimization disabled so these values can be inspected, to gain further insight into why ConvertNodes ends up being called recursively so many times (the file in `findings/default/crashes` is only ~1kb in size, so it's possible the invalid data triggers an endless loop of recursive calls.
